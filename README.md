# FreeScoreTKD

Open Source Taekwondo Poomsae Software

FreeScoreTKD is free and open source software for traditional and recognized
sport poomsae scoring on wireless tablets or smartphones. It is intended to be
installed on a Raspberry Pi as a web appliance, or run off an AWS EC2 instance.
It has recently expanded to include scoring for freestyle, as well as creative
breaking using the USATKD rules. 

Please see the [project website](http://mikewongtkd.github.io/freescoretkd/)
or the [documentation](https://github.com/mikewongtkd/freescoretkd/blob/master/trunk/docs/userguide.md)
for more details.

## Acknowledgements

Huge thanks to **LC** for advice and corrections. 

All bugs and errors are my own.

**UPDATE**

After 14+ years of development (the repository started under Subversion,
hence the trunk branch, and even earlier with CVS) others have entered
the fray and helped contribute. Thanks to: AP, KG, and JM for their patch
contributions. So now, only some of the bugs and errors are my own.

## Contact
